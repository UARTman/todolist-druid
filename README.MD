# To-Do Application

The main goal of this project is to test the capabilbity of Druid library for writing GUI applications in Rust.
The test is mostly successful, as the patterns given are pretty easy to understand and use. The library is still a bit wet,
though. 

## Running the app

If you're using linux, install GTK+ 3 before building.

To build and run this, just use cargo:

```shell
cargo run
```
